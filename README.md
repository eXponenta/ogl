## Usage

If installed amongst your project files, importing can be done from one single entry point.

```js
import { ... } from './path/to/dist/index.js';
```

Else if using a bundler or import maps with node modules, then import directly from the installed node module.
```js
import { ... } from 'ogl-extend';
```
By default, the ES source modules are loaded (`dist/index.js`).

This means that starts from 0.0.93  is breaking changes.
